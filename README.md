  - Exposes `/model/predict.py` script that generates model predictions for the specified dataset
- Evaluator (in `/evaluator`)
  - Evaluates the Model based on the predictions generated for test dataset in a way that the results can be compared with different models/runs of the same adjusted model
  - Exposes `/evaluator/evaluate.py` script that evaluates the Model and uploads results to Neptune
